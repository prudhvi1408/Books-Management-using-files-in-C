# Books-Management-using-files-in-C
By using this project we can manage the details of the books easily. We can perform the operations like add the details of the book into a file(name of the book, author,publiucation,publication year), we can search the already existing books, we update the details of the book,view all the existing books, delete the details of the existing book..etc. 
First we will create a user defined hedaer file. In this header file we will declare the datatype of the book using structure. We will write the all the function prototypes used in the project.
Next we will create a "Book.c" file in which we will define all the functions.
